# back-end-jeweltime üèóÔ∏è üíé ‚öíÔ∏è üìì

## Overview

`back-end-jeweltime` is the backend component of [Jewel Time](https://jeweltime.onrender.com), a web application that serves as a digital field notebook for jewelers. Designed to support the creative process, it offers features such as project tracking and retrieval of current precious metal prices. Crafted as a capstone project for Ada Developers Academy Cohort 19, it leverages Flask and MongoDB to document metalsmithing projects.

## Collaboration
